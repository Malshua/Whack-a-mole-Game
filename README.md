# Whack-a-mole-Game
The Whack a mole game is a simple game project one can enjoy at their leisure smacking down moles and gaining points for each mole smacked.
the file has a bit of html, css and javascript.
There were lots of interesting logic and little bits of twists and turns here and there.
i learnt how to use and practiced how to manipulate the DOM while also listening to click events.
